# Esp32 Dev Module Hardware Boards
Hardware and circuit board designs to enhance esp32 Dev Module connectivity

I think that I have about average circuit board design and soldering skills for an (older) mechanical engineer. As mostly a hobbiest developer, I tend to develop reusable functionality focused circuit boards as opposed to project specific circuit boards. My soldering skills are OK for 0.1 inch center parts. 0805 surface mount parts are at or beyond my limit.

I am sharing these eagle board designs that I have found to be useful; mostly as a sort of tidy bridge between a breadboard and a project specific design. Unless otherwise specified, they are for (30 pin) esp32 Dev Module boards.
