# Lcd 3.5 Connectors
This design connects one side of an esp32 Dev Module (ESP32-LEFT) to a LCD touch screen display. The display uses all of the GPIOs on that side except two. A four pin connector supports connecting the display mounted SD socket using a shared SPI. The two unused ports are routed to a four pin I2C connector.
